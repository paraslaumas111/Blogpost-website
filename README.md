#About -

BlogPost website (Tech Stack: PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js)

 • Developed an interactive and visually appealing website for families to track and display their travel history across the
 globe.
 
 • Enabled users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts, providing a full suite of
 functionalities for managing content.
 
 • Designed and tested RESTful APIs using JSON data format for efficient data exchange. Utilized Postman for thorough
 testing and experimentation with the APIs.
 
 • Set up two dedicated backend servers, one to handle client-side requests from the React frontend and the other to
 manage API requests. This separation ensures optimized performance and better scalability.
 
 • Implemented server-side API requests using the Axios Native Node module, ensuring reliable and streamlined
 communication between the servers and the database.
 
 • Employed PostgreSQL as the database solution to ensure reliable data storage and retrieval, supporting the platform’s
 robust data management needs.
